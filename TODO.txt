Create pipeline for extracting data for players for each league
✅ 1. Extract player scouting report from FBref
✅ 1.1 scout_summary & scout_full 
✅ 1.2 See all stats above x% in scout report
1.3 Extract all 9 tables of player (stats_standard_dom_lg, stats_shooting_dom_lg, stats_passing_dom_lg, stats_passing_types_dom_lg, stats_gca_dom_lg, stats_defense_dom_lg, stats_possession_dom_lg, stats_playing_time_dom_lg, stats_misc_dom_lg)
1.4 Per90
1.5 Filter by season

✅ 2. Plot data points from scout report --> PowerBI
✅ 2.1 Create script that transforms into more suitable csv file (; and ,)
✅ 2.2 Add functionality to pipeline inside scraping

✅ 3. Only calculate per90 for integer columns --> Not same order as merged, but doesn't matter as we still have the data
